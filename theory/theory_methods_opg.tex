\frametitle{The Optimal Trial Petrov-Galerkin (OPG) Method}

Brunken et al. (2018)~\cite{Demkowicz2011}.
\\~

Similar motivation to that of the DPG method but with test norm
chosen as that which is naturally induced by the problem such that the method is
optimal in the sense of having unity continuity and inf-sup constants, and a
trial norm corresponding to the L2 norm.
\\~

Main difference, global solve for the optimal test space followed by computation
of discrete trial space through the application of the adjoint operator.

Cauchy-Schwarz on bilinear form:
\begin{align} \label{eq:cauchy_scwarz_advection}
b(v,\varg{u})
\le\ & \sum_{\fe{V}}
|| - \nabla v \cdot \varv{b} ||_{L^2(\fe{V})} || u ||_{L^2(\fe{V})}
+
||\jump{v}||_{L^2(\fe{F})} ||f^*||_{L^2(\fe{F})} \\
\le\ &
\underbrace{\left(
\sum_{\fe{V}} || - \nabla v \cdot \varv{b} ||^2_{L^2(\fe{V})} + ||\jump{v}||^2_{L^2(\fe{F})}
\right)^\frac{1}{2}}_{||v||_\fspace{V}}
       \times \\
  &
\underbrace{\left(
\sum_{\fe{V}} || u ||^2_{L^2(\fe{V})} + ||f^*||^2_{L^2(\fe{F})}
\right)^\frac{1}{2}}_{||u||_\fspace{U}}.
\end{align}

Equality obtained (unity continuity and inf-sup constants) for the choice of
test functions:
\begin{alignat}{3}
u =\ & -\nabla v_u \cdot \vect{b}\quad && \text{in}\ \fe{V}, \\
f^* =\ & \jump{v_u} && \text{on}\ \fe{F}.
\end{alignat}

\end{frame}

Imposing sufficient constraints on the test space,
\begin{align}
  \exists\ \text{a unique}\ v_u \in \fspace{V}\ \text{such that}\ u = B^*v_u,\ \forall u \in \fspace{U}.
\end{align}

The equivalent problem can then be obtained:
\begin{align}
& \text{Find}\ w_h(u_h) \in \fspace{V}_h\ \text{such that}\\
& b(v_h,u_h) \coloneqq b(v_h,B^*w_h) \coloneqq (B^*v_h,B^*w_h) = l(v_h)\ \forall v_h \in \fspace{V}_h,
\end{align}

and subsequently compute the solution.
