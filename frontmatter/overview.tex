\frametitle{Motivation and Goals}

The success of Bubnov-Galerkin finite element methods for the solution of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) arises from the relation between the variational formulations and the minimization of an energy functional.
\\~

In the case of convection-dominated or purely hyperbolic PDEs, additional stabilization is required in regions of high local P\'eclet number and is most commonly introduced either through the introduction of a suitably chosen numerical flux or through the modification of the test space (resulting in a Petrov-Galerkin method).
\\~

Taking the linear advection equation as a model problem, our goal is to present our initial investigation into determining the \emph{optimal} form of stabilization.
